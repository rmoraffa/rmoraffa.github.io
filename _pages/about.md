About Me
======
I am a tenure-track assistant professor of computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science at Arizona State University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). Before that, I received my B.S. in computer software engineering from Sharif University of Technology. 
  My research spans machine learning, artificial intelligence, causal inference, and data mining, with a specific focus on developing trustworthy and responsible machine learning algorithms.  I am also interested in integrating a causality perspective into machine learning, paving the way for the advancement of causal machine learning.
